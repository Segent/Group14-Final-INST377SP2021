        Since the start of the pandemic, people of the world have had to stay inside and find other means </br>
        of entertainment. The majority of these people turned to watching movies and TV shows. Many of </br>
        these people scrolled for hours searching for movies that meet their criteria, only to not find it and </br>
        give up. This system will help these people find their ideal movie quicker and more efficiently. Our </br>
        system gives movie enthusiasts the ability to use a filter to find movies that fit their desired criteria. </br>
        Based on their input in categories such as genre and favorite actors, we will sort through the movies </br>
        in our database and be able to match their input with the best movie for that user. This process will </br>
        be much quicker than scrolling through a movie watching platform and deciding what “looks good” </br>
        to the individual. We are excited to be able to help the user find their ideal movie.
